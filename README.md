# HackaEngage - Campus Party Experience - 1st Place

This is a Python/Flask solution created to engage the over 4000 employees who work at the Parque Dom Pedro mall. The solution harmonizes with IntranetMallâ€™s API and encourages logistics to sign up for the existing employee access control system. It develops an automated system that checks and sends news, announcements, and store promotions using WhatsApp.

The project won first place at the HackaEngage hackathon, held in September 2019.
